# Liquibase Demo Files

A small project containing some demonstration liquibase scripts. There is an Ant build file showing how to run Liquibase from Ant, and a Groovy script showing how to wrap Liquibase as a command-line tool. Run `liquify --options` for a list of commands.

The project also contains a SQL script suitable for creating a demo schema to refactor.

You should use these materials as a template only. For a more sophisticated approach, see the [Liquibase Workshop](http://github.com/tlberlund/liquibase-workshop) files, which contain patterns for Gradle-based Liquibase invocation.
